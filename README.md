### What I learned

This was the first time I used mix-blend-mode and this was the first project where the desktop and mobile design was different (with other projects you just had to change the width of the elements) so it was a pretty good practice.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.image-wrapper img {
    display: block;
    border-top-right-radius: 15px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 15px;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    mix-blend-mode: screen;
    opacity: 1;
}

.image-wrapper::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    background: var(--accent);
    opacity: 1;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    z-index: 99;
    border-top-right-radius: 15px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 15px;
}
```
